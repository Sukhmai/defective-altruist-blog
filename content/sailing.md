My recent interest has been economics and geopolitics. As a person who loves clicking through wikipedia for hours, it often feels like every interest is transient and competing for attention. It's just a matter how long that transient feeling can last. As I grew older and realized that one must trade breadth for depth, a little part of my soul died. Being a specialized worker is rewarded in a world of 8 billion people, so you must choose what knowledge you seek.

Ok but I did enjoy learning about computer science. It's a pretty broad field of study all things considered. But I missed learning about history, lucky for me there's a whole cottage industry of pop-historians on youtube. 

Apparently if you were a rich aristocrat in Europe, you can insure that your son was a proper "renaissance man" and they conceivably held the forefront of knowledge in almost every discipline.

Maybe ChatGPT is our modern day "renaissance man". It relies on bluffing as much as they probably did when confronted with something they did not know.
