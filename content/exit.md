The main goal of many startup founders is to build a product that could vaguely threaten one the major tech companies enough to be bought by them. This is termed a "successful" exit. Everyone gets their bag, and any possibility for technological change is crushed. When people say there is innovation under capitalism, this is what they mean. A large company becomes a larger and larger behemoth constantly swallowing up even the smallest prey. If we're even luckier, it might merge with another sprawling corporate entity, creating a shiny new conglomerate.

In the early to mid aughts, graduates from prestigious institutions were shoveled out to consulting and finance in droves. Supposedly intelligent people were encouraged to abandon any pursuit of pushing the human project forward, in favor amassing greater amounts of capital for the already wealthy. As the decades have rolled by, the people who plan their life from the age of 10 have shifted their goals from finance to technology. The unambitious set their sights for a spot at Google or Facebook, knowing that they will be satisfied with their life's work being a minor contribution to one of their thousands of products. The more cunning realize they can squeeze these companies for more on the outside, rather than from within. Neither profess their love of the computer, for they never had any.
