**I design and develop the best personal websites money can buy.**

The kind of website that gets [shared](https://twitter.com/freeshreeda/status/1668389564799504386) and [talked about](https://twitter.com/ungatedcreative/status/1668442076407644161) just for how cool its design is. 

If this is the sort of thing you're interested in creating, you can hire me. Let me know on Twitter ([@joodaloop](https://twitter.com/joodaloop)) or by email (judah.private@gmail.com). You can also hire me for some of the [other things](#postscript) I can do with websites. 

Chances are, you're coming to this page having seen [my work](#the-portfolio) before, and with a particular project in mind. In which case, you could skip straight to the [Process](#the-process) section to read about what working with me is like. 

_The rest of this page is an attempt to convince you of my skill, and explain why you should want a well-crafted personal site in the first place._

## the problem

*The web is full of mediocre websites.* The most popular kind of templates out there are tired variations of the same landing page, Linktree profiles, and blog themes. There's nothing *wrong* with these templates, they're useful, always in demand, and often provided for free. 

If you want to get a bunch of words onto the internet as cheaply as possible, there's never been more ways to go about it. Most blogging platforms will cost you less than $5/month, Tumblr and Twitter are free. 


**But a personal website is not a blog.**

Sure, it might include a chronological list of posts, but it ought to be more. It ought to have personality. 

This is your website, you can choose what parts of you to show off, and how to display them. You might just want to make a list of things you love, and have that be your home on the web. You might want to build a [timeline of your life](https://colly.com/). You might want a music collection in the form of a magazine.  


**You shouldn't have to fit yourself into a pre-existing theme.**

Not when you can do all of the above, and in your own way. You can build a [synthesizer](https://brandnewbox.com/inthestacks/) into a webpage, it's completely legal and not that hard to pull off. You can even have your site be a retro desktop GUI. That's pretty [common](https://github.com/syxanash/syxanash.github.io/blob/development/src/resources/remote-desktops.json), actually. You can have a page with weather, that switches its theme according to the current temperature in your city. Let the Writers<sup>TM</sup> have their Substacks, you don't have to be tied to their bland UI if you'd rather have	 something better. 

A website could be a [commonplace notebook](https://piperhaywood.com/). It could look like an [entire app](https://brianlovin.com/). It might have cool algorithm-generated art on the home page. It might even be a [playable game](https://nateparrott.com/). Even a minimal blog can feel extremely [personal](https://manuelmoreale.com/). But in each of these cases...

**…the people who built them are people who are good at making sites.** 

They’ve been designing, writing code, and thinking about websites for years, decades even. *They know what they want, and what’s possible.* They spent months fiddling with their sites, bringing them closer to their imagined ideal, to a state that fills visitors with a sense of delighted admiration.

*Meanwhile, the rest of the world has to make do with yet another free template, or some kind of variation of a paid one.*

**Or do they?**

*I don't think so.* I work with people to get a sense of their aesthetic and preferences, and then design sites that they wouldn't be able to dream up on their own. I've worked with descriptions like "Whole Earth Catalogue", "[LaTeX paper](https://twitter.com/joodaloop/status/1654565087439380480)" and "teenage engineering", and produced some of my best sites. I believe this is a repeatable process.

## the process

**STEP I:** You send me a list of words that describe the aesthetic you’re hoping for, the type of content you want to present, the out-there ideas and things you love. Accompany those descriptions with screenshots, moodboards, and other websites you think are great examples of personal sites. Ideally in the form of a Google Doc.

**STEP II:** I go away for a few days to think things over, asking you a few questions while I do it. Then I come back with three (or more) rough, distinct design directions you can choose from. These will probably include layout sketches, and a list of feature ideas. 

**STEP III:** If you're sufficiently excited by the ideas I put forward, we finalise the key design choices and features and I go build the whole thing on the platform you prefer. This usually takes a week if I'm not too busy.

**Step I** is important for me to get a feel for the kind of site what you want, and how confident I am that I can, in fact, build you something nice. **Step II** costs a flat fee ($250) and, in the worst case, leaves you with the best 3 high-level ideas I could think of. 

Once you pick a direction, decide on what features to include, and what platform you want the site to be hosted on, I can start with **Step III**. Pricing here is a fixed quote that I give you based on the aforementioned factors, as well as the level of urgency. 

**Platform price ranking (cheap-to-more-expensive):** Single-page site, Hugo, Eleventy, Ghost site, Wordpress theme.

I offer a free month of light maintainance/bug fixes after delivering the site. And if you ask nicely, I'm usually open to making changes further down the road too.

## the product

I want to make beautiful websites. I want to make messy websites. I want to make websites that feel like a cozy attic. I want to make elegant websites. I want to make impeccably crafted websites. I want to make unreasonably intricate websites.

	<p> Where is the Pyramids of Giza of websites? What is the Cathedral of Notre Dame or Temple of Artemis of websites?</p>
	<p>Where is the web Acropolis!</p>
	<p>We must build it! We must put forth this wonder into the world. I have convinced myself. Though I still don't yet know where to begin.</p></a>
</blockquote>

At the moment, there are some things that I do really well, which makes me suited to particular kinds of design work. Here’s a quick summary of the main skills.

**Typograghy:** I am singularly obsessed with the art of arranging type on screens, perhaps infamously so. Most sane people do not care about the difference between ` line-height: 1.44em ` and ` line-height: 1.45em ` , but this is the kind of thing that keeps me up at night. 

**Semantic HTML:** There are a 142 different tags in the official list of HTML elements. Each of them has an intended purpose, and offers specific, useful functionality. Again, many people might not know that the `details` element exists, let alone what it’s meant to be used for, but I think it's worth caring about.

**Desire-shaping + raw ideas:** If you don't know what's possible on the web, I'm happy to do that part for you. It's around 70% of the value that I do provide. You give me broad descriptions and preferences, I supply the ideas and/or give shape to yours.

**Speed + quality:** I consider them to be near-synonymous. I believe that a 99/100 PageSpeed score is a bare minimum, and work on getting it [even better](https://twitter.com/joodaloop/status/1655923954790416392?s=20). I polish corners and debug layouts across devices more obsessively than I should. 

I like when sites are usable on mid-market devices, and follow the ideas of progressive enhancement whenever I can. 


## postscript

I am also open to less intensive projects, like **typographical audits** for existing websites. Here, I look at your site, and inspect all the headings, tables, paragraphs, and font choices. I then suggest any improvements I can think of, and implement them if necessary. 

I also do quick **re-skins** of existing themes. Send me a theme you’re using/want to use, along with a list of aesthetic cues, and I’ll change up the necessary stylesheets. 

One of my current projects involves designing a Hugo theme to put **books on the web**. So if you're looking for a way to publish long-form writing that goes beyond regular blog posts, I'd probably love to work with you. 

In general, if your project is attempting a **novel approach** to displaying information on the web, I'm likely to be interested.
