My motivation for learning languages is bad. I have unshakable yearning for understanding humanity and ever person that has ever lived. To this end when I was rather young I told myself I should learn the most useful languages to be able to communicate and the understand all the world, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and Arabic. The problem is that I've been stuck on Spanish as my first foreign language for about 10 years, and honestly I've probably regressed after leaving school.

In order to learn a language (in the modern way), you should do both a lot of deliberate practice accompanied with many many hours of passive exposure to the language. The problem I stumble into is that I'm just not particularly interested in much Spanish-speaking TV or youtube. The reason is obvious, which is that I don't really have a particular interest in the language outside of the utilistic aspect, which is not nearly enough motivation to power through the countless hours necessary to approach being conversational.

There is alternative ways to fix this problem, which is simply drop yourself in a place where you're forced to use Spanish to communicate, but that requires a large commitment. A more practical answer is to push myself a little harder to stop ignoring the cultural output of nearly half a billion people and truly find something I'm interested in.

Oh I and I've never kept it as a consistent habit in the first place. Time to roll the boulder up the hill again I guess.
