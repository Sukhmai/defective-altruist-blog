We live in an age of infinite opportunity to share yourself. The primary method people have of interacting with the world in 2025 is to produce, consume and distribute "content", which is a vague enough to describe literally anything. And yet I've always felt a discomfort in the idea of sharing myself over the internet. I've been a terminally online user of the internet since the ripe age of 12, but I have spent 99.99% of that lurking. Maybe it's because of early indoctrination to not reveal you're a kid on the internet, but more likely it comes from both laziness and and a lack importance placed on what I had to say. 

It's somewhat self-aware to realize as a kid that you don't know much about the world, but you grow up and realize everyone's just pissing their thoughts and identities everywhere. The internet town square is polluted with bot armies, the beautiful uniqueness of strange humans and everything in between.

This leads to the other conclusion, which is that even if you were to make something share your thoughts, you're screaming into the void hoping somehow people will be spit back out.

In reality, maybe you're just making "content" to share with your friends and family. The real promise of the internet though in my mind is that you should be able to find like-minded individuals through it. The promise of a recommendation algorithm is that it will find the people most likely to enjoy the thing you made, but it seems to work in a way that emphasizes parasocial relationships rather than facilitating social life between equals.

Anyways I'm hoping I'll get better at sharing myself and meet cool people along the way.
