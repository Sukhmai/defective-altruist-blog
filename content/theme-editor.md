title: Theme Editor

The editor is not the most intuitive tool. You'll be able to use it if you're comfortable with CSS (which is not that hard to pick up!), but it could still use a little polishing. I'm working on it.

Until then, the combination of eight themes and four layouts (32 different combinations!), ought to provide enough variety for most users.
