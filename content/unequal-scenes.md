I stumbled on https://unequalscenes.com/ the other day while doing my language learning routine. My second youtube account recommended me a street interviewer talking to residents of Mexico city about inequality. That lead to this website which showcases amazing shots of stark inequality, populations coexisting with a tiny physical wall separating life expectancy, way of life, and living room space.  

In America we often separate the rich from the poor with leagues of space. The rich live in far off gated suburbs outside the city, with no public transportation. The poor are cordoned off into either urban ghettoes or sparse rural land. In most of the world the poor and rich live in the same expansive metropolises, sharing the same wall to kick a soccer ball off of. 

The conversation of our times is inequality, the failed experiment of neoliberalism (or late stage capitalism if you choose to view it that way) causing skyrocketing inequality between nations, between cities and even between neighborhoods. I recently read The Divide by Jason Hickel, which dives deep on the myth of poverty reduction over the past 50 years, would recommend.

Now I want a print from https://unequalscenes.com/, but alas I have no apartment for this print. Hopefully soon.
