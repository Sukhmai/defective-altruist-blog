*Designed and developed by [Judah](https://joodaloop.com).*

The site features an interactive sidebar on desktop, and a simplified interface on mobile/tablets. Content is of two main varieties: 

1. Long, carefully-written essays.
2. Brief notes on disparate topics.

The site itself is a static site built with Hugo, and stored on Github. Pages are served through Netlify's CDN.
