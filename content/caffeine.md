For a long time I've insisted on referring to alcohol and caffeine as drugs. I'm sure this has annoyed one of my friends at least once. Obviously as far a stimulants go caffeine is the mildest, and alcohol is probably is least powerful depressant (I wouldn't know I'm more of an upper guy (ok but not like that you know what I mean)). 

For a long time I resisted caffeine. I felt that I shouldn't be dependent on a drug to function daily. I made all through college pulling many a all-nighter while avoiding the temptation of an energy drink. Now that I'm a regular user, I shudder to think I how managed that. Anyways I was drugged against my will. When I interned at Roblox, they had bai flavored water which I would drink constantly. The caffeine is only listed in tiny text at the back of the bottle, and needless to say I just thought I really was quite productive in the office. I only found out there was caffeine in them when I returned for my full time job. 

This disconnect between how productive I felt in my internship and my slow and lazy mind during full time work compelled me into a caffeine addiction. Then I discovered if I took pre-workout I was more energetic about pushing my limits in the gym. 

I have a slippery slope mindset, so it's hard for me to distinguish the rules I used to have for myself. I once said drugs should only be used for fun, ideally socially around friends. Take adderall to play smash with your friends and do combos that you could never do otherwise. Don't take adderall to study for an exam, because drugs == FUN and you're breaking the sanctity of fun.

But now I do caffeine daily to enhance my performance. How far will I go?
