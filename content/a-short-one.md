I've skipped the last couple days. I could never be https://www.jquiambao.com/. I'm just not a consistent person anyways. I bet that guys never been on a 48-hour multiple addys dopamine bender tho (because he's smarter than me). 

I don't know why I'm not a consistent person, which isn't to say I can't be consistent on certain habits like gym for extended periods of time, but in general I don't view myself as a super consistent person. I blame this on the fact that as a kid I got away with procrastinating everything to the last minute, and this never caught up to me even in college. Me and my close friend like to joke that we perfected the art of estimating how long an assignment will take, always joking about how submitting an assignment with 20 minutes to spare is a huge amount of breathing room. I'm not joking though when I say I've submitted assignments when the software 0 minutes remaining more than once.

This sounds like bragging, but I obviously think for the real world the practice of discipline and learning to consistently do the work is very important for a child to learn. I think I've gotten better at this though (hopefully).
