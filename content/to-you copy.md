Recently I've been informed that I arrived at the end of things. Communism was declared dead before I was born, and there is no alternative to the way of things. AI will come and render human thought quaint, and so we have every big tech company seated at the World Series of Poker Final Table where the first place and only prize is the fate of humanity. Best not bubble this tournament Sam Altman. If we're lucky, anthropogenic climate change will cancel the tournament before it's heads-up.

Perhaps the tech bros are wrong and it turns out enhanced text-prediction clankers can't out-compete 4 billion years of evolution intellectually. Then we can look forward toward a slow death where the digital machine slowly replaces human connection, and reproduction grinds to a halt. Why would you have kids at the end of time? There is no after, you might as well enjoy while you can. Maybe you would have kids if you could afford it, but there's no need for a future labor supply, so why would the ruling class let you afford it? They need all the money they can get before it's time to descend into the bunkers.

The books say we just recently avoided the end. Apparently the clear minds of Kennedy and Khrushchev prevailed, preventing full-scale nuclear war. Now our leaders are emperors without clothes, so they can freely end our misery in minutes.

The nice thing about the apocalypse is that there’s a lot of different doomsday cults to pick from. Every ideology has a corner on the map, feel free to jump around and try a few. Maybe when you're young you start out as a rationalist, and then become a zizian. Or you could go from a libertarian to a constitutional monarchist. Maybe you zigzag a little and go from watching Ben Shapiro to Hasan Piker to Nick Fuentes. Your beliefs don't matter anyways, there’s nothing you can do to change anything when you're on the last page of the book. You should probably just pick the one that has the people you want to hang out with.
