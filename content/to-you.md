I often wonder what my future wife is doing right now. The person who I will entwine my fate with is living a life somewhere, completely unaware of my endless curiosity about her. When I bring this up to my guy friends, they respond that she's probably getting railed by some other dude. Thanks guys. Real helpful.

I imagine the feeling of her hugging me from behind, the moment where the weight of a quarter of a century of loneliness finally billows out of me. I imagine her head resting in my lap as her eyes grow heavy, and I think at least for a moment I've reached the eye of the storm. I imagine touching my forehead against hers, knowing that there once existed someone that understood me better than I understood myself. I imagine holding her, hiding the outside world from her view.

It feels as though those of us that have lived their lives relatively alone live across a canyon from those who have spent most of their time in one relationship or another. Most of us one day jump across that gap, to stay on the other side at least for a little while. Every day I wake up, hoping this is the day where I can find my fellow traveller. Maybe she's been there before and knows the way. Maybe she's never been close.

Sometimes I find myself chasing false images of the truth. I don't know where to look for the real thing, so I heed advice from friends and foe. I carve my body in a naive emulation of a Greek statue. I enter into portals of the dating marketplace, saying things that don't sound like me, obsessing over a presentation that no one looks at. I try older methods, but she's definitely not going to be there. I don't even know why I'm there. Sometimes I tell myself that desire is the root of all suffering, but I fail to unclench my tight grip.

I have infinite flaws. I've hacked away at them over time, while trying to preserve their beauty all the same. An impossibly hard dance that we all are forced to perform. I'd like to hold you still for a moment, to return the innocence of childhood expression for a single person who existed for a sliver of time on this tiny dot in the vast universe.
