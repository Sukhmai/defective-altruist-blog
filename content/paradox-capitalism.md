First of all I'm no expert on economics, but I always end up at logical paradoxes within capitalism. When you do proofs in mathematics, everything can be derived from axioms and the logical conclusions arrive at full your heart with joy, and you can hold those truths close to your heart knowing they can be translated a million ways and still hold their cogency.

The first problem I have is the inherent disconnect with profit existing at all. The theory behind capitalism is that rational consumers will choose the cheaper option between two identical products. Thus assuming infinite competition, a company that generates profit would get outcompeted by an identical company that simply lowers prices instead of extracting that profit. Instead we see profit margins increase decade by decade, markets consolidate into oligopolies, and less and less competition. 

How can we point to a system that inherently trends to consolidation and market concentration and claim that capitalism drives innovation through competition. I think I need to read more books on economics honestly...
